AI resources for  BCIT CST students.

This content is designed to complement, not replace, the materials provided in our lectures. While I strive for accuracy, itâ€™s important to rely on the official lecture slides and resources as our primary source of information.


Making these resources takes time, effort as-well as money to pay for some of these AI services. Feel free to give any support to keep this going. You can also email me at rodrielnt@gmail.com, for any suggestion to make this more practical for us , or if you wanna help out with putting them together.
