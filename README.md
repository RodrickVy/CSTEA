# CSTEA
AI resources for  BCIT CST students.

This content is designed to complement, not replace, the materials provided in our lectures. While I strive for accuracy, itâ€™s important to rely on the official lecture slides and resources as our primary source of information.

Making these resources takes time, effort as-well as money to pay for some of these AI services. Feel free to give any support to keep this going. You can also email me at rodrielnt@gmail.com, for any suggestion to make this more practical for us , or if you wanna help out with putting them together.

### HOW IT WORKS
Each topic covered will have a corresponding study set , which includes a podcast, a quizlet study set (flashcards, notes,tests), lecture notes and pdfs of the learning-hub lecture slides for that topic.

Note: The topics don't exactly match the number and order of the lectures on learning hub, they follow the book more closely. E.g. lectures 5 and 6 are grouped together as they are covering the same thing and hence need the same study set. Lectures 5a and 5b (covering debugging and unit testing) are put together.
